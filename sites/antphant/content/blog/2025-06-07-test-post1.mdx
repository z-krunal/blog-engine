# Getting Started with Next.js and MDX

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building modern blogs with Next.js and MDX. In this post, we'll explore various features and best practices for creating engaging content.

## Why Next.js and MDX?

Next.js provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications, while MDX allows us to write content in a familiar Markdown format with the power of React components.

### Key Benefits

1. **Performance**: Next.js's static generation capabilities
2. **Developer Experience**: Familiar Markdown syntax
3. **Flexibility**: React components in your content
4. **SEO**: Built-in optimization features

## Code Examples

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

// Usage
<Greeting name="World" />
```

And some TypeScript code:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const getUser = async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
  return response.json();
};
```

## Custom Components

You can use custom components in your MDX files. For example, here's a callout:

<Callout type="info">
  This is an important note about using custom components in MDX.
</Callout>

## Images and Media

Always include descriptive alt text for images:

| MDX | Markdown with JSX | âœ… |
| Code Highlighting | Syntax highlighting for code blocks | âœ… |
| Custom Components | React components in content | âœ… |
| SEO | Meta tags and structured data | âœ… |

## Lists

### Unordered List
- Item 1

## Math Equations (if supported)

If you have math support enabled, you can write equations:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote content.

## Task Lists

- [x] Write the blog post
- [x] Add code examples
- [x] Include images
- [ ] Review and edit
- [ ] Publish

## Custom MDX Components

<CodeBlock
  language="javascript"
  code={`console.log("Hello, MDX!");`}
  showLineNumbers
/>

<YouTubeEmbed videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

Remember to:
1. Use proper heading hierarchy
2. Include alt text for images
3. Write descriptive link text
