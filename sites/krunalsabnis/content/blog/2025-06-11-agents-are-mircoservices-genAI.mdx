## Agents Are the Microservices of GenAI

> If you’re coming from microservices or event-driven systems, you’re more prepared for GenAI than you think. Agents aren’t a new idea — they’re just microservices with a prompt.

### From Monoliths to Prompt Monsters

In traditional software, we evolved from monolithic applications to microservices. In GenAI, we’re doing the same — moving from monolithic prompts to orchestrated agent systems.

But prompt-only apps don't scale:
- Hard to debug
- Fragile logic
- Hallucinations everywhere
- One model does everything

Sound familiar? That’s what we called “legacy monoliths” in backend engineering.

### Agents = Microservices

Here’s how the analogy holds:

| GenAI Agent                         | Microservice Equivalent       |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| One job: answer, search, summarize | Bounded responsibility        |
| Tools (APIs, search, code, etc.)   | External dependencies         |
| Memory (short/long term)           | Local state or cache          |
| Composed via LangGraph             | Chained via events/queues     |
| Retryable, observable              | Just like a resilient service |

LangGraph is essentially your event-driven orchestrator.



### Hallucinations Are Runtime Errors

Hallucinations aren't just prompt issues. They're often **poor coordination problems**, like:
- Missing retrieval logic (no grounding)
- Overloaded prompts (poor separation of concerns)
- Lack of fallback (like no retry queue)

In microservice terms: it’s a failed circuit breaker, not a bad UI.



### Scaling = Composability

You don’t scale LLMs by tweaking prompts. You scale by:
- Separating agents
- Composing flows (LangGraph)
- Observability (token logs, failures)
- Explicit state transitions



### Real Example

Instead of one huge prompt:
> Summarize this doc, score sentiment, suggest actions.

Break it into agents:
- **Summarizer Agent**
- **Sentiment Agent**
- **Action Planner**
- **LangGraph Flow** to connect them

You now have: **testability, reuse, observability**.



### Final Thought

Agents aren’t just a GenAI trick — they’re architecture.  
If you’ve worked with microservices, you already *think* in agents.  
You’re just swapping RPC with prompt calls, and services with models.
